# ITGM727 - Databases and Dynamic Website Programming
## Exercise 1: User Information


### Learning Outcome
After completing this exercise, students will be able to use PHP script to successfully:

* create Web pages with embedded PHP
* utilize PHP variables and operators in a Web page
* call a PHP file using an HTML form.


### Procedure
Using the materials covered in the course so far, create a PHP script that accomplishes the following three tasks:

1. Design a Web form to collect information from a user.
2. Write the necessary scripts to:
    * parse the information from the user
    * display the results based on the form data filled out by the user.
3. As you write your PHP script, choose one of the following options:
    * Option 1: Have your Web site provide a list of five interests (e.g., sports, music, art, dance, history, science, current affairs, etc.). Then ask users to select one or more interests from that list. As a result of that selection, have your program display three suggested Web site links per interest expressed.
    * Option 2: Have your Web site provide a form to collect the user’s birthday. Then ask users to enter their birthday. As a result of that information, have your program display the user’s birthstone and information about it and the corresponding Western zodiac sign and its characteristics.
    * Option 3: Have your Web site provide a quiz consisting of five multiple-choice questions on any topic. Ask users to answer all the questions and submit them. As a result of a user’s submission, provide feedback in terms of number of correct and incorrect answers. For any incorrect answers, provide the correct answer.
4. Specifically, proceed as follows:
    1. Use a two-part form:
        * one page that displays the form
        * one page that processes the form.
    2. Regardless of which option you chose, set up a form for the user to enter his or her name, in addition to any other information needed.
    3. Use appropriate variable names to pass information from your form to your form processor.Î
    4. Validate the data entered before processing the results.
    5. Display the appropriate message as feedback to the user.
    6. Use the most appropriate decision statements to determine the results to be displayed. Your responses will be output using echo statements.
    7. Allow the option to start over after the results are displayed.
    8. Your code should be commented appropriately.
